					Do you know the <span>Halicti</span>? Perhaps not. There is no great harm done: it is quite possible to enjoy the few pleasures of
					life without knowing the <span>Halicti</span>. Nevertheless, when questioned with persistence, those humble creatures with no history 
					can tell us some very singular things; &amp; their acquaintance is not to be disdained if we desire to enlarge our ideas a little 
					upon the bewildering rabble of this world. Since we have nothing better to do, let us look into these <span>Halicti</span>. They
					are worth the trouble.

					The focus of critique is essentially the cluster of relations that bind the one to the other, or the one to the two others,
					power, truth, &amp; the subject. And if governmentalization is really this movement concerned with subjugating individuals
					in the very reality of a social practice by mechanisms of power that appeal to a truth, I will say that critique is the
					movement through which the subject gives itself the right to question truth concerning its power effects &amp; to question
					power about its discourses of truth. Critique will be the art of voluntary inservitude, of reflective indocility.
